# Welcome to your our friendly practice repo for those learning Git or Github
This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate and teach the best GitHub has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `index.html` file (so it can render a web page), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency.

## Learning GitHub Markdown is fun! 
### Insert an imperitive command and a code block below after creating a L3 sub heading:

***

  - Run the below command in your terminal of choice

```
git clone https://github.com/vetsindevops/demo-repository.git
```
  - Run the below file to create a code file

```
echo "let y = 42; console.log(x);" >> hello.js
```

  - Now that you have a .js file create the appropriate .gitignore file

```
echo "# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
